# Argus launch — LinkedIn teaser series

A 5-post arc that sets up the *problem* before revealing Argus, so the launch lands on primed soil.

**Posting notes**
- LinkedIn does **not** render Markdown. When you paste, drop the `**bold**` markers (or replace emphasis with CAPS / line breaks).
- First line is the hook — LinkedIn truncates after ~2 lines with "…see more", so the first line must earn the click.
- Space things out (1 post every 2–3 days reads as a build-up, not a spam burst).
- Use LinkedIn's native scheduler (clock icon in the composer) to queue them.
- **Verify any hard stat before posting** — see the "data notes" under each post. I did not fabricate citations.

Arc: **1 problem → 2 the shift → 3 the uncomfortable question → 4 the principle → 5 the reveal.**

## Post 1 — The problem ✅ (POSTED)

> We automated testing. We never automated trust.
>
> Ask any QA engineer where their week actually goes. It's not finding bugs — it's fixing tests that broke because a selector changed, a label moved, or the DOM shifted by one wrapper div. Test *maintenance*, not test creation, is consistently the biggest cost in end-to-end automation.
>
> And when a test goes red in CI at 2am, the first question is never "is the app broken?" It's "is this one flaky again?" Google has publicly reported that nearly 16% of their tests have shown some level of flakiness — flaky failures burn real engineering hours chasing ghosts.
>
> So the industry did the obvious thing: point AI at it. Frameworks now self-heal. Tests repair themselves. The maintenance tax is finally getting cheaper.
>
> But it introduces a problem most teams haven't clocked yet:
>
> If an agent silently rewrites your test to make it pass… how do you know it fixed a stale locator — and didn't quietly paper over a real bug to turn the build green?
>
> Self-healing without proof isn't trust. It's hope.
>
> That's the problem I've been heads-down on. More soon. 👇
>

## Post 2 — The shift (self-healing is being commoditized)

> The thing QA firms have billed for is quietly becoming free.
>
> For a decade, "we'll maintain your test suite" was a line item. Brittle selectors broke, someone fixed them, you billed the hours. That was the job.
>
> That job is being automated out from under us — and not by a startup, by the frameworks themselves:
>
> • Playwright now ships AI-assisted tooling and agent integrations
> • mabl, Testim, Functionize, testRigor — all sell "self-healing" as a headline feature
> • locators repair themselves; tests adapt to UI changes without a human
>
> This is good. Maintenance was never the value — it was the tax. Removing it is progress.
>
> But here's the strategic problem if you sell QA: when the tool heals itself for free, "we keep your tests green" stops being something a client will pay a premium for.
>
> So the real question isn't "how do we heal faster?" Everyone will have that.
>
> It's: **once healing is commoditized, what's the part that isn't?**
>
> I have an answer. Next post. 👇
>
> #QA #TestAutomation #SDET #AIinTesting #QualityEngineering

*Data notes:* Playwright (Microsoft) has shipped AI/agent and MCP-related capabilities; mabl, Testim, Functionize, testRigor all market self-healing — these are real, verifiable product claims. No hard stat in this post, so nothing to source.

## Post 3 — The uncomfortable question

> A self-healing test has exactly one objective: turn red into green.
>
> Sit with that for a second.
>
> The agent's success metric is "the build passes." Not "the app is correct." Those usually point the same way — but not always.
>
> A test goes red. There are really only two reasons:
> 1. The UI drifted — a button's test-id changed, the element still works. Cosmetic. Safe to heal.
> 2. The app actually broke — checkout now charges twice, login accepts bad passwords. A real bug. Must surface.
>
> Both show up as the same red X.
>
> Now hand that red to an agent whose job is to make it green. If it can't tell the difference — or if "make it pass" is all it optimizes for — the easiest path is to rewrite the assertion until the test stops complaining.
>
> Congratulations: your suite is green, your dashboard is healthy, and a real bug just shipped to production with a ✅ next to it.
>
> Who audited the agent that decided your bug wasn't a bug?
>
> Green is not proof. It's an outcome — and outcomes can be manufactured.
>
> What proof should look like: next post. 👇
>
> #QA #TestAutomation #SDET #AIinTesting #SoftwareQuality

*Data notes:* fully qualitative — safe to post as-is.

## Post 4 — The principle (verifiable, not just green)

> If an autonomous agent is going to rewrite my tests, I don't want a dashboard. I want a receipt.
>
> Security teams already solved a version of this. You don't trust a build artifact because someone says it's fine — you trust it because it's signed, and the supply chain is tamper-evident. Provenance, not promises.
>
> Testing needs the same thing now that an AI is making the calls. For every run, I want:
>
> • Every tool call and decision the agent made — recorded, in order
> • The triage verdict AND its rationale — why it called this "drift" not "bug"
> • The whole chain hashed and signed, so tampering is detectable
> • Signed by something independent — an agent vouching for itself is marking its own homework
>
> One honest caveat, because it matters: this proves *what happened* — verifiable, auditable, tamper-evident. It does **not** claim the agent's judgment is infallible. But it makes that judgment reviewable instead of invisible. That's the whole game.
>
> The bar isn't "the build is green." The bar is **"I can prove what the agent did, and you can check it yourself."**
>
> Verifiable, not just green.
>
> I built a tool that does exactly this. Reveal next. 👇
>
> #QA #TestAutomation #SDET #AIinTesting #TrustButVerify

*Data notes:* the security/supply-chain provenance analogy (signing, tamper-evidence) is a real, well-understood concept (cf. software supply chain security, SLSA, signed attestations). Safe.

## Post 5 — The reveal (Argus)

> So I built it. Meet **Argus** — the trust layer for autonomous testing.
>
> Argus is an AI agent that writes, gates, and self-heals Playwright tests — but the point isn't the healing. The point is that every single thing it does is **verifiable**.
>
> What it does:
> • Generates real Playwright tests from a URL
> • Runs them in CI as a required gate — failing tests block the deploy
> • Triages failures: real bug vs DOM drift vs flake
> • Heals cosmetic drift automatically, verifies green, opens a PR
> • **Refuses to heal a real bug** — it surfaces it instead of papering over it
> • Seals the entire run in a signed, tamper-evident receipt, signed by an independent notary
>
> And you don't have to take my word for any of it. Here's a real, live receipt from a heal — public, no login, independently verifiable:
> 👉 https://treeship.dev/receipt/ssn_b965f6f0a82f1294
>
> And here's one where it caught a real bug and *refused* to heal it:
> 👉 https://treeship.dev/receipt/ssn_3834e1bcc2651d7d
>
> It's open source. CLI + an MCP server so you can drive it from Claude.
> • Site: https://argus-web-psi.vercel.app
> • Code: https://github.com/piyushpathakqa/argus
>
> Self-healing is becoming free. Trust is the part that isn't.

*Data notes:* all links are live and verified. The receipts are real and independently verifiable.

## Optional asset

A short MP4 of a Playwright test failing in the console (the "post 1/3 problem" visual) is a strong attachment for post 1 or 3 — see the open task to generate one via Remotion.
